GET: The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server. It is a safe and idempotent method, meaning multiple identical GET requests will not have any additional side effects.

POST: The POST method is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. It is non-idempotent, meaning that multiple identical POST requests may result in different outcomes on the server.

PUT: The PUT method is used to update or create a resource on the server. It is idempotent, meaning that multiple identical PUT requests will have the same effect as a single request.

DELETE: The DELETE method is used to delete a resource on the server. It is idempotent, meaning that multiple identical DELETE requests will have the same effect as a single request.

PATCH: The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource on the server. It is typically used to update only specific fields of a resource.

HEAD: The HEAD method is similar to the GET method, but it only returns the response headers, not the actual content. It is useful for checking the status of a resource without downloading its entire content.

OPTIONS: The OPTIONS method is used to request information about the communication options available for a resource. It is often used to support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests.

TRACE: The TRACE method is used to retrieve a diagnostic trace of the resources' handling on the server. It is not widely used in practice.

CONNECT: The CONNECT method is used to establish a network connection to a resource. It is mainly used for proxy servers.
